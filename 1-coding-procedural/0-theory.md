# Procedural Coding

The procedural coding is the way you code, one thing after the other, so instruction after instruction.  
For this course we will use one of the most common coding language, Java, because it has very strong styntax but has some very complicated thing automated.
Remember you don't have to learn Java but you have to learn coding!

For follow the course read first the file `x-theory.md`, at the end of some chapter, it could be the reference to an exercise, before read next chapter, please do the exercise. The exercises are written in the file `x-exercises.md`, in the exercises could be asked to test your code, the instructions will be in the folder `x-tests` and the solutions of the exercises are in the folder `x-solutions`.
If you want to learn to code the suggestion is to try to create the program then test it and at the end if you need to check with the solution, otherwise if you want to throw your time away execute directly the solutions and nobody will know ;).

## Get the environment ready

Java is programming languegge who requires some tools, for execute it and for develop it. You can chose if install on your machine only the execution tool or install the excution and the develop tools.  

- JRE - Java Runtime Environment:  
Tool for run Java programs, it exists for all kind of platofrm (so you can run the same program on all platforms).
- JDK - Java Develpment Kit:  
Tool for compile and create Java programs, also this exists on all platforms.

Please install the JDK on your machine, you can find the files to download and the instructions on oracle website and looking for informations in internet.  
You can do it!

After the installation check if you had correctly installed everything.

```sh
user@host:~$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.3+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu219.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.3+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu219.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
user@host:~$ javac -version
javac 11.0.3
```

Your environment is ready for develop awesomes programs in Java.

Now proceed with the very [first coding lesson](./1-theory.md).
